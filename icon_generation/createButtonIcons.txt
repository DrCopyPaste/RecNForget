To re-create (new) button icons consider the following:

each button should have 4 different images:
- image when enabled (default black)
- image when disabled (default gray)
- image when selected or mouse over (default black, but hollow icon is filled)
- image when pressed (inverted color, default white)

use Inkscape to convert source svgs to png
=> these should be the default-enabled-icons

RecNForget.ImageConverter
 creates the disabled and inverted icons
 these are created in the subfolder icon_generation\disabled or icon_generation\white
for the filled icons use the different svgs that refer to *icon*.filled.svg
