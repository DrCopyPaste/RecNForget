To reproduce the files the way I did for the github-releases page you will need the following:

Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019
.NET Framework SDK 4.7
WIX Toolset 3.11.2.4516 (see wixtoolset.org)
currently still built using Windows 7

The Setup-Project "RecNForget.Setup" can be built after "RecNForget" itself was build using the Release-Build-Configuration -
this will get you a msi-file like the one you see on the github-release page.
