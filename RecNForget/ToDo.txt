move app.config values to registry
(now that we install this to a programs folder writing into programs folder is a big nono, this makes running the application require admin rights)

allow restoring app.config defaults via settings window

use netfx extension in wix installer to precompile .net dlls and exe into IL to improve startup performance
(granted, building the setup project requires WiX Toolset to be installed, but is there a way to reference the dll without it being an explicit path? maybe nuget?)

enable repairing/upgrading via msi-installer

do something useful with the "change" option when in "programs/features"-menu

add uninstall actions to remove custom registry keys (auto start, and other configuration)

use TargetFileName or similar in wxs file to not explicitly spell out application file name

add Signature!?!

icons for buttons

show record (red circle) in bottom right corner when recording

enable output as mp3/other (configurable (conditionally))

add possibility to edit sampled audio (cut it at beginning and end and save as new file or override it)

FIX: not all settings from settings window take effect immediately some require restart

maybe settings and hotkey windows are a bit "too always on top"?

readme.md howto file with screenshots

how to build
	include batch files?

break down HotkeyService into HotkeyService and AudioRecordingService

allow disabling some hotkeys explicitly (decreasing the amount of hotkeys, the listener has to listen to)

refactor, ioc, constants, magic strings, identifiers etc

sound level normalization (configurable (conditionally))

Allow including screenshots with sampled audio file (for later remembering which movie/whatever thing the sample belonged to)
	This could also be the fraps replacement :D (well kinda)
