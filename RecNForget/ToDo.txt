remove user config when uninstalling

allow restoring app.config defaults via settings window

enable repairing/upgrading via msi-installer

do something useful with the "change" option when in "programs/features"-menu

add uninstall actions to remove custom registry keys (auto start, and other configuration)

use TargetFileName or similar in wxs file to not explicitly spell out application file name

add Signature!?!

icons for buttons

show record (red circle) in bottom right corner when recording

enable output as mp3/other (configurable (conditionally))

add possibility to edit sampled audio (cut it at beginning and end and save as new file or override it)

maybe settings and hotkey windows are a bit "too always on top"?

readme.md howto file with screenshots

how to build
	include batch files?

break down HotkeyService into HotkeyService and AudioRecordingService

refactor, ioc, constants, magic strings, identifiers etc

sound level normalization (configurable (conditionally))

use netfx extension in wix installer to precompile .net dlls and exe into IL to improve startup performance
(granted, building the setup project requires WiX Toolset to be installed, but is there a way to reference the dll without it being an explicit path? maybe nuget?)

allow disabling some hotkeys explicitly
(decreasing the amount of hotkeys, the listener has to listen to - this todo actually comes from a time when I thought about hotkeying everything, like chanding output folder, changing prefix etc... - for now this is not needed)

balloon tips are not showing when in full screen (netflix for instance, is there a way to enforce it anyway?)
	there is for instance taskBarIcon.BringIntoView(); but it does not seem to work, dont see any possible always on top or topmost option for the balloon tips

is providing different prompt modes really necessary? When starting this project I thought there might be situations where you dont want to just record to the autogenerated file name,
but instead enter it before or after recording, but I think this is really an edge case, who would do that? :D maybe in a future release I will re add the enum and actually use the option

Allow including screenshots with sampled audio file (for later remembering which movie/whatever thing the sample belonged to)
	This could also be the fraps replacement :D (well kinda)
