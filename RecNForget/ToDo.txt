how to build
	include batch files?

break down HotkeyService into HotkeyService and AudioRecordingService

allow disabling some hotkeys explicitly (decreasing the amount of hotkeys, the listener has to listen to)

refactor, ioc, constants, magic strings, identifiers etc

sound level normalization (configurable (conditionally))

Allow including screenshots with sampled audio file (for later remembering which movie/whatever thing the sample belonged to)
	This could also be the fraps replacement :D (well kinda)
