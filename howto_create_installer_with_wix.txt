how to create an upgrade:
- change first 2 digits via version.json if needed, 
- DO NOT CHANGE the naming pattern of the msi files (RecNForget.Setup.A.B.C.D.msi)

great video tutorials:

getting started:
- get toolset from wixtoolset.org (appropriate to your vs installation)
- this means u need the WiX Toolset build tools (and if you want the vs extension)
- restart might be advised or we cannot build wix projects?
- add a "Setup Project for WiX v3" to the solution
- add references to that project to each project you need to copy/install files from (really every project, even if that project is already referenced by a reference?)


for .net projects:
- include additional namespace:
	xmlns:netfx="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/NetFxExtension"
- now you can add a subnode to File nodes like (and have the code precompiled to IL)
	<netfx:NativeImage Id="$(var.SampleApp.TargetFileName)" Platform="32bit" Priority="0" AppBaseDirectory="INSTALLFOLDER" />

Product node
- apply correct Name, Manufacturer and Version to Product
- leave Language="1033" ?

- have a MediaTemplate node under Product node
	with EmbedCab="yes" to include cab into setup file

- Guid for Upgrade Code: THIS MUST ONLY BE DONE ONCE (The Upgrade Code communicates whether a product comes from the same branch (meaning it can be upgraded/is compatible with other same upgrade codes, but different Product Ids)
- Product Id remains "*" will generate a guid for each new build, better replace it


A Component node describes a logical unit (combining several files that belong together)
- provide Id and Directory
- must have unique Guid
- can contain multiple File nodes

A File node points to a specific file
- provide Id and Source (thats the actual source file name)
- best practice: only ever have one file per component and set KeyPath="yes" (and Checksum="yes")

Add support/info links to pograms and features menu:
- Add Property nodes under Product node
	<Property Id="ARPHELPLINK" Value="gitissuesurl" />
	<Property Id="ARPURLINFOABOUT" Value="point to online about/readme document" />
	<Property Id="ARPURLUPDATEINFO" Value="point to latest releases page" />
