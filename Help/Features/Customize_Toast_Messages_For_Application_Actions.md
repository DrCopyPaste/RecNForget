You can configure RecNForget to show toast messages above the task bar for all the actions it does.
(this is enabled by default)

To change this setting:
- open the menu at the top left of the main window
- click on 'Open Settings'
- click on 'show toast messages'
- exit the settings window by pressing the accept button

Keep in mind that system sounds coming from toast messages can be configured via Taskbar->Settings in Windows itself.
