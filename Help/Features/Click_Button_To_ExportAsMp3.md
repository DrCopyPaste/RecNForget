You can export the selected file as mp3 by clicking the export button right next the selected file name in the Selected File Control

Export Bitrate can be set in Settings -> Output -> Mp3 Export Settings -> Bitrate
The exported filename will be automatically generated from the selected original file.
If you want to be prompted for an export name you can enable the "prompt for exported file name"-dialog under
Settings -> Output -> Mp3 Export Settings

NOTE: To do this you need to have the selected file control enabled (Context Menu-> 'Show Selected File Control')
