# customize check for updates
You can have RecNForget automatically check for updates when it starts.
(this is enabled by default)

NOTE: This will NOT automatically install any update - you will still be prompted to install and can cancel this if you do not want to.

To enable or disable this setting:
- open the menu at the top left of the main window
- click on 'Open Settings'
- click on 'check for updates on start'
- exit the settings window by pressing the accept button
