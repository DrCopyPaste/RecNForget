The Recording Timer Control can be shown in the main window - this allows
- automatic recording stop after a given time
- delayed recording start after a given time
- time spans are entered right to left (seconds first) in the following format: d:hh:mm:ss
(this is control is disabled by default)

- if the "Stops after"- timer is enabled, a recording session  will be automatically ended after that time span
- "stop recording" can still be forced by hitting record again (if "Stops after"- timer is already running)
- "Stops after" can also be enabled while already recording

- if the "Starts after"- timer is enabled, the "start recording" action will be delayed by that time span
- "start recording" can be forced by triggering record again (if "Starts after"- timer is already running)

To enable or disable the Recording Timer Control:
- open the menu at the top left of the main window
- click on 'Show Recording Timer Control'
