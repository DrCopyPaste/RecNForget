# customize output folder
You can change the output folder RecNForget puts recorded files into.

To change this setting:
- open the menu at the top left of the main window
- click on 'Open Settings'
- click on 'File name pattern'
- now enter the file pattern you desire
- you can enter a placeholder such as (Date) to ensure a unique file name
- if you don't, RecNForget will try to make file name unique on its own and just append a timestamp to you file name
- enable you new file pattern by pressing [Return]
- exit the settings window by pressing the accept button
